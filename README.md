## Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, which were forked from popular repos I liked 
and the further on extended to my taste.

* tmux and vim configuration was based on (square/maximum-awesome)[square/maximum-awesome]
* bash prompt was based on (ch3pjw/bash_prompt)[ch3pjw/bash_prompt]

Tmux does detect if you are using OS X or linux and adjusts the copy commands accordingly.
